----> Batch Processing in Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)
Batch processing in JDBC allows you to group multiple SQL statements into a single batch and execute them together,
which can significantly improve performance when you need to execute multiple statements against a database.

----> Why Use Batch Processing?
1.Improved performance (reduces network calls)
2.Reduced JDBC driver overhead
3.Atomic execution (when needed)
4.Efficient for bulk operations

----> Methods for Batch Processing
JDBC provides three key methods for batch processing:

1.addBatch() - Adds a statement to the batch
2.executeBatch() - Executes all statements in the batch
3.clearBatch() - Clears the current batch
